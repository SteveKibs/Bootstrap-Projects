<p>That this is needed, desperately needed, is indicated by the
incredible uptake of Bootstrap. I use it in all the server software
I'm working on. <blockquote class="pull-right">This is awesome</blockquote>And it shows through in the templating language I'm
developing, so everyone who uses it will find it's "just there" and
works, any time you want to do a Bootstrap technique. Nothing to do,
no libraries to include. It's as if it were part of the hardware.
Same approach that Apple took with the Mac OS in 1984.</p>
